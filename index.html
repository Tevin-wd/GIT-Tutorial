    This is the video that I learned about GIT and that I will use to add more info to this page using the git workflow and adding it to the github page. Mainly will want to use this video to add images from the conflict part of the video to explain that in this repo.-->

        <h1>GIT tutorial</h1>
        <p>In this tutorial I will be going over 5 of the easiest GIT comands to learn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <h3>git pull</h3>
        <img src="img/git-pull.png" alt="git-pull">
        <p>
            The 'git pull' command is going to make sure you pull in any and all changes that were made to the master
            branch. After confirming the
            files are up to date you can make any changes or continue working on what you planned to do.</p>

        <h3>git add</h3>
        <img src="img/git-add.png" alt="git-add">
        <p>The 'git add -A' command will save all the changes made so that they can be pulled up again if something
            happens and they can be committed at any point.<br />
            The -A is making sure all the changes are being added into staging.</p>

        <h3>git commit</h3>
        <img src="img/git-commit.png" alt="git-commit">
        <p>The 'git commit -m "leave your notes
            here"' command will add
            all the changes made to <b><u>Staging</u></b>. <b><u>Staging</u></b> means they are ready to be merged to
            the master branch.<br /> The -m "" means
            commit message. You will want explain this commit in as much detail as possible with as little words
            as possible.</p>

        <h3>git push</h3>
        <img src="img/git-push.png" alt="git-push">
        <p>the last command you will use is the 'git push' command. That will take your changes from staging and
            merge them with the master branch. </p>
