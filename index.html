    This is the video that I learned about GIT and that I will use to add more info to this page using the git workflow and adding it to the github page. Mainly will want to use this video to add images from the conflict part of the video to explain that in this repo.-->

    <h4>git pull</h4>
    <p>First thing you want to do when working on a project or in a team/group is the 'git pull' command. This is going to make sure you pull in any and all changes that were made to the master branch. After confirming the files are up to date you can make any changes or continue working on what you planned to do.</p>
    <h4>git add</h4>
    <p>After making the neccessary changes your next git command you would use is 'git add  -A' which will add all the changes made to staging. staging means they are ready to be merged to the master branch. The -A is making sure all the changes are being added into staging.</p>
    <h4>git commit</h4>
    <p>Next, you are ready to commit your chagnes to the master branch. 'git commit -m "leave your notes here"' is the command you would use when commit your changes to the master branch. The -m "" means commit message. You will want explain this commit in as much detail as possible with as little words as possible.</p>
    <h4>git push</h4>
    <p>the last command you will use is the 'git push' command. That will take your changes from staging and merge them with the master branch. </p>
