        GIT tutorial
        
        In this tutorial I will be going over 5 of the easiest GIT comands to learn.
    
        git pull
                -The 'git pull' command is going to make sure you pull in any and all changes that were made to the master
                branch. 
                -After confirming the files are up to date you can make any changes or continue working on what you planned to do.

        git add
                -The 'git add <filename>' command will save that files changes made so that they can be pulled up again if something                     happens and they can be committed at any point.
                -You can put an -A or * to make sure all the changes are being added into staging.

        git commit
                -The 'git commit -m "commit message"' command will add all the changes made to Staging. Staging means they are ready to                 be merged to the master branch. 
                -The -m "" means commit message. You will want explain this commit in as much detail as possible with                 as                 little words as possible.
                -You can also use 'git commit -A' to commit any files you've added with 'git add', and also commit any files
                you've changed since then</p>

        git push
                -The last command you will use is the 'git push' command. That will take your changes from staging and
                merge them with the master branch. 
        
        git status
                -The 'git status' command will give you a list of files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit or will                 let you know your branch is up to date.
